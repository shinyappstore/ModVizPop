# ModVizPop: Empowering Real-Time PK/PD Simulations

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/ModVizPop](https://shinyappstore.com/a/ModVizPop)__

ModVizPop is an application designed to empower teams in performing real-time pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic simulations. It offers a comprehensive set of built-in model libraries. This tool focuses on simulating population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) models with variability, using differential equations. The application provides an intuitive user interface with key inputs for conducting simulations and options to visualize plots, and equations. Users can choose from the built-in PK/PD ODE library or incorporate their own user-defined models from local or project directories. Additionally, the interface also includes advanced features such as overlaying external data on a simulation, setting specific scenarios as references, and performing sensitivity analysis-based simulations. This tool can be valuable for project teams in evaluating potential scenarios, facilitating collaborative decision-making throughout the drug discovery and development process.
